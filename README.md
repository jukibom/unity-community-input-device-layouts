# Unity Community Input Device Layouts

A package of community device layouts for the Unity Input System along with a tool for building them for users of those devices.

## Motivation

There are a number of devices which do not work in the new Unity Input System. This a problem for developers as the only real solution is for them to get their hands on the hardware and add support manually. This project aims to become a repository of third party peripheral definitions by virtue of a distributable tool for users with specific hardware to inspect, author and test input definitions.

Very much a work in progress! Input (lol) is welcomed!
